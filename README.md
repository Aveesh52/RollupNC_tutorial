# RollupNC_tutorial
This is a [circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) and [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) / [websnark](https://github.com/iden3/websnark) tutorial, using [RollupNC](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/RollupNC) as an example. It takes you through how to build RollupNC, circuit by circuit, with generated inputs to test the circuits out.

(Created for [IC3 2019](https://www.initc3.org/) and inspired by [GuthL's rollup circom tutorial](https://github.com/GuthL/roll_up_circom_tutorial).)
